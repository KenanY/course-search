  "description": "Writing poetry may become an addiction. This workshop continues with matter-of-fact techniques and some fancy ones as well. Students write poems and read some difficult and thrilling poetry of the past and present. By the end, students may be able to say, with Humpty Dumpty, I can explain all the poems that ever were invented - and a good many that haven't been invented just yet. Juniors or seniors who have not taken CRW 1101 or CRW 1301 must have strong composition skills. (C) (WR)"
