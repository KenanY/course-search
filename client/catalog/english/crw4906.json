  "credits": 3,
  "description": "George I said, \"I hate all Boets and Bainters.\" For battle-scarred veterans of previous workshops who now want the full treatment, this is a small workshop for serious poets who want to write their names in water, as long as they are also in the Norton Anthology. Students often go from this class into MFA programs in poetry. Admission by manuscript review during advanced registration (refer to department website); by prerequisite during drop/add."
