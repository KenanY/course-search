  "description": "This course is designed to stimulate exceptional students from a variety of backgrounds to think creatively about real-world problems that threaten the sustainability of today's society. Creative but practical problem solving emphasizing critical thinking, critical appreciation of epistemological diversity and the need for better communication is stressed. During the second and third sections of the course, guest speakers will provide the basis for examination of intra- versus inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches to problem solving. Students will see how their own work (honors projects, proposed graduate and professional study and career goals) can contribute meaningfully to attainment of societal goals. (WR)"
