  "description": "Group activities strengthen knowledge of secondary mathematics, especially topics from precalculus and the transition to calculus, including contexts that can be modeled using linear, exponential, polynomial or trigonometric functions. Topics include conic sections, parametric equations and polar equations. Explorations involve multiple representations, transformations and data analysis techniques, and are facilitated by various technologies."
