  "name": "Linear Algebra 1",
  "credits": 4,
  "description": "Linear equations, matrices, vector spaces, linear transformations, determinants, eigenvalues and inner-product spaces. Includes both theory and computational skills. Develops the ability to reason through, and coherently write, proofs of theorems. For math majors, this course serves as a transition from a study of techniques into more conceptual math; for engineering and science majors, it serves also as a coherent foundation in linear algebra."
